This is the codebase for the nightmare amalgamation of /TG/station, Goonstation, and Baystation12 codebases for the game Space Station 13.

Space Station 13 is a round-based roleplaying game set on a cassette-futuristic station where every job from Clown to Head of Security is played by users. Watch out for shifty individuals, as you may be subject to kidnapping, blood sacrifice, murder, or a dock in pay from a particularly upset Head of Personnel.

## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation:

On **2021-01-04**, /TG/station changed the way to compile the codebase.

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `daedalus.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
