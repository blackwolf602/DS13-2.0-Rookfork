		"The native language of Gamuioda is referred to as 'Gamuid' by their population. However, 'Moffic' is used as an exonym among other species.",

		"Written transcripts of Gamuioda history remain largely untranslated to modern Gamuid, that most of the populace knows. \
		However, more recent transcripts detail the progress of Gamuioda working to accelerate the process of first contact - to get in touch with extra-terrestrials. \
		There is a long history of research and scientific development done by Gamuioda, with lower-class Gamuioda focusing on providing materials and other needed produce for upper-class researchers to utilize in advancements.",

		"Upon meeting other lifeforms outside of their planet, notably Humans, the Gamuioda would begin to offer their population as a labor force for stations, ships, and other facilities requiring employment. \
		There wasn't a fixed paycheck at first for moths when they first began work. This led to an economic crisis and a huge spike in inflation on their homeworld when converting credits into their currency, the Posis, \
		With some careful consideration, Gamuioda working on Nanotrasen facilities are paid 20% less than most, and are given a weekly lamp to supplement the unpaid money. \
		This has pleased 98% of surveyed moths, including the upper class.",

		"The working, lower, and upper classes of Gamuioda are scattered across their homeworld of Paraco, including other under-studied planets, with the wealthy more focused on settling down in rain forests, primarily to take shelter in tall trees. \
		The variety in weather and temperature endemic to Paraco has given rise to a vast amount of clothing styles, with a key focus on embroidered designs on cloth, \
		though most often those working on stations and other facilities wear heavy-duty equipment or their assigned uniforms.",
