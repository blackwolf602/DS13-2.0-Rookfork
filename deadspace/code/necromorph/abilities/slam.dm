/*
	Slam is an AOE melee attack, primarily used by the necromorph brute.
	Slam strikes a three-tile arc either side of an epicentre.
	Any mobs in the affected area take heavy damage. This damage is multiplied if the victim is lying down, or otherwise incapacitated
	Any standing mobs in the affected area which are smaller than the attacker, will be knocked down for a time
	Any dense nonmob atoms in the affected area are hit twice
